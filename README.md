- **[Mistral 7B]**:
    - Powers the chat functionality.
    - Provides intelligent responses based on user queries and repository context.
    - Enables code understanding and generation.
    - *(Please replace this with the actual model or API you are using, e.g., 'OpenAI GPT-3 API' or 'Hugging Face Transformers library with [Model Name]')*

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- GitHub Account
- [GitHub OAuth App](docs/github-oauth-setup.md) set up for local development.
- [API Key/Token for AI Model] (if applicable, e.g., OpenAI API Key or Hugging Face Token). See [docs/huggingface-setup.md](docs/huggingface-setup.md) for Hugging Face setup.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd github-repo-chat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your GitHub Client ID and Secret, and AI API Key (if needed):
     ```env
     GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
     GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
     [AI_API_KEY_ENV_VAR]=YOUR_AI_API_KEY  # e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... or HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=hf_...
     ```
     Refer to the documentation for setting up [GitHub OAuth](docs/github-oauth-setup.md) and [Hugging Face API](docs/huggingface-setup.md).

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## üíª Usage

1. **Login**: Click the "Login with GitHub" button to authenticate with your GitHub account.
2. **Select Repository**: Choose a repository from the list in the sidebar to start chatting about it.
3. **Explore Files**: Expand the repository item to view the file tree and select specific files for context.
4. **Chat with AI**: Type your questions or prompts in the chat input area and send messages to the AI.
5. **Receive Intelligent Responses**: The AI will provide responses based on your queries and the context of the selected repository and files.
